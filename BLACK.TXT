Blackjack is a player-versus-house game. The point of the game is to try to beat the dealer by getting a value that is more than the dealer's, but not more than 21. The dealer will let you get the cards first, and your job is to get as close to 21 without busting (getting above 21). If you bust, you will automatically lose the hand. You can decide to stand at any point and not draw any more cards, but the dealer always have to draw so he will have at least 16 or higher in total of his cards. Once the dealer has 16 or higher, he will automatically stand. The aim of blackjack is very simple but, as you will find, it is extremely intense with a lot of built up tension to see what cards you get dealt. See if you can beat the dealer!

How do slots work?
They used to be mechanical games with spinning reels with symbols printed on each reel. But they’re now powered by computer programs called random number generators. You put your money in, spin the reels, and hope for the best.
The odds are programmed in such a way that the house has an edge in the long run. This means that you might be able to win in the short run, because the game is random. But as you approach the long run, you can expect to get closer to seeing the mathematical expectation.
How do you win at slots?
Slots are completely random. So don’t expect to find some kind of winning zig-zag strategy.
